          <p class="px-2">Slack is so engrained in your workplace. You cannot email your coworkers anymore: they wonâ€™t read them. You cannot share long-form documents about product vision: all discussions now happen in threads. You cannot expect a curated review for your Pull Request: just link it in a public channel and hope someone will notice.</p>
          <p class="text-large px-2"><strong>Maybe there is a better way</strong>. Maybe you can stop slacking for a single day. Just turn it off.</p>
          <p class="px-2">Rediscover the pleasure of spending two hours writing down your ideas without immediate replies. Get back into the zone by coding for an entire morning without a stream of pending notifications. Rejoice in the tranquillity of designing prototypes that will be reviewed where they live, not in a chat.</p>
