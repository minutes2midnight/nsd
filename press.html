        <p><strong>Los Angeles (CA) â€“ Thursday, 29th July 2021</strong>. Slack is so engrained in the workplace. You cannot email your coworkers anymore: they won&lsquo;t read them. You cannot share long-form documents about product vision: all discussions happen in threads. You cannot expect a curated review for your code: just drop a link in a public channel and hope someone will notice.</p>
        <p>Maybe there is a better way.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Rediscover the pleasure of spending two hours writing down your ideas without immediate replies. Get back into the zone by working for an entire morning without a stream of pending notifications&rdquo;, says Zed, the collective behind the initiative.</p>
        <p>Get a taste of productivity back, stop slacking for a day. August 26th is <kbd>#noslackday</kbd>.</p>
